MACHINE MODEL
 - Not a simulator. Not really an emulator either. 
 - global variables: A, X, Y, SF, VF, BF, DF, ZF, CF, SP (data only), (no PC) 
 - 64k memory: u8 data[65536]

CODE MODEL
 - no absolute code addressing 
     (assembler allows jumps to defined labels)
     (indirect jump not supported)
 - code stack is separate from data stack (SP) and is inaccessible
 - not relative branch distance limitations

DATA MODEL
 - same as 6502

I/O
 - ESC #0 -> reads stdin into A
 - ESC #1 -> writes A to stdout
 - ESC #2 -> sleep A tenths of a second
 - ESC #3 -> terminate program (or RTS from top level)
