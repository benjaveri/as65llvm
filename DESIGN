scala parser -> AST -> LLVM IR (as text) -> assembly/executable (using command line llvm)

great reference: http://nesdev.com/6502.txt

each instruction translates to it's speci implementation in IR, leaving
 it up to llvm optimizer to make code better. could also have implented
 a bunch of calls to instruction implementations, but that is no fun!

use .org and db to initialize data ram
db does not emit to code space
code does not emit to ram; code does not advance .org
